        "# **AI-Powered Document Intelligence Automation Platform MVP**\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook serves as a production-ready MVP for a Multi-Modal Document Intelligence system. It is designed to solve complex business problems associated with high-volume document reviews, such as mortgage processing, legal discovery, and HR automation. Unlike standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems that often suffer from \"Context Contamination,\" this platform utilizes Intelligent Document Boundary Detection and Metadata-Rich Chunking to ensure that queries are routed to the precise document context required.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🛠️ MVP Objectives**\n",
        "- **Contextual Fidelity:** Eliminate \"hallucinations\" caused by mixing data from different documents within the same vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Intelligent Automation:** Automate the classification and segmentation of bulk-uploaded files (e.g., a single PDF containing a resume, an ID, and a contract).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multi-Model Versatility:** Allow users to switch between different LLM engines (Gemini, Mistral, Phi-2) based on performance and latency needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Production Readiness:** Integrate OCR (Tesseract), vector search (FAISS), and professional PDF report generation into a unified workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🏗️ Key Technical Architecture**\n",
        "The platform is built on a modular pipeline that ensures data integrity from ingestion to output:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ingestion Layer:** Supports PDF and Image files with Hybrid OCR (PyMuPDF + Tesseract) to handle scanned documents.\n",
        "- **Intelligence Layer:** Uses LLM-driven classification to identify document types and detect logical boundaries between pages.\n",
        "- **Storage Layer:** Implements Metadata-Rich Chunking using LlamaIndex and FAISS, creating segregated vector indices for each document type to prevent cross-contamination.\n",
        "- **Orchestration Layer:** A central router predicts the most likely document type for a given query and routes the request to the specific vector index.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🌟 Core MVP Capabilities**\n",
        "- **Multi-Modal Routing:** Automatically detects if a query is about an \"Invoice\" vs. a \"Mortgage Contract\" and searches only the relevant documents.\n",
        "- **Logical Document Segmentation:** Breaks down large, combined PDF files into individual logical units (e.g., separating Page 1-3 as a \"Resume\" and Page 4 as an \"ID\").\n",
        "- **Performance Auditing:** Tracks ROUGE scores and response times to evaluate the quality of the AI's answers.\n",
        "- **Interactive UI:** A Gradio-based interface featuring a PDF viewer, audit logs, and a model-switching dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **📖 How to Operate**\n",
        "- **Environment Setup:** Run Section 1 and 2 to install dependencies and configure your Gemini API Key in the Colab Secrets.\n",
        "- **Initialization:** Run the global configuration cells to load the BGE embedding model and initialize the default LLM.\n",
        "- **Select Engine:** Use the switch_llm function or the UI dropdown to select your preferred AI model (e.g., \"Gemini 2.0 Flash\").\n",
        "- **Upload & Process:** Upload your documents via the Gradio interface. The system will automatically classify and index them.\n",
        "- **Query & Audit:** Enter your business questions. Use the \"Audit Log\" tab to view performance metrics and download a professional PDF summary of the session.\n",

By decoupling model definition from model execution, the system can seamlessly transition between high-performance cloud APIs (Gemini) and specialized local models (Mistral, Phi-2) without code duplication. This flexibility allows for rapid prototyping and cost-effective scaling within restricted hardware environments.\n",

This isolates technical complexities—such as **4-bit quantization configs**, device maps, and specific tokenizer paths—away from the core application logic. This modularity ensures that adding a new model only requires creating a new factory function rather than rewriting the orchestration layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **T4 GPU Optimization (Quantization):** Local models are configured using `BitsAndBytesConfig`. This ensures large models like Mistral 7B are compressed into 4-bit precision, significantly reducing their VRAM footprint from ~15GB to ~5.5GB. This optimization is what makes multi-model experimentation possible on a standard T4 instance without sacrificing significant reasoning capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stateless Definition:** These functions define how to build the \"brain\" of the AI but do not activate it immediately. This \"on-demand\" approach is a critical memory management strategy; it prevents the system from attempting to load all models into VRAM simultaneously, which would cause an immediate `CUDA out of memory` error."

        "2. **LlamaIndex Orchestration (**`chunk_with_llama_index` **):** An alternative high-level path using the `SentenceSplitter`. This is superior for complex documents as it respects paragraph and sentence boundaries, preventing a chunk from being cut off in the middle of a critical legal clause.\n",

        "3. **Metadata Injection:** This is the \"Secret Sauce\" of the platform. Every chunk—no matter how small—is stamped with its `doc_type`, `doc_id`, and `page_range`. This ensures that in the retrieval phase (Section 7), the system can filter out irrelevant document types with 100% precision."

        "1. **Semantic Query Routing (** `predict_query_document_type` **):** Before searching the database, the system uses the LLM as a \"Traffic Controller.\" It analyzes the user's intent to predict which specific document category (e.g., Mortgage Contract) holds the answer. The use of Regex parsing ensures that even if the LLM is verbose, the system extracts only the valid JSON routing instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Segregated Indexing (** `build_indices` **):** Unlike basic RAG which creates one giant bucket of data, this system builds a primary FAISS index and several sub-indices (silos) based on document types. This allows for lightning-fast, high-precision searches within a specific document class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adaptive Retrieval (** `retrieve` **):** This function makes a real-time decision. If the Router has high confidence (>0.7), the search is restricted to the specific \"silo.\" If confidence is low, it falls back to a global search. This \"Hybrid Approach\" maximizes accuracy for specific questions while maintaining flexibility for general queries."

        "\n",
        "2. **Performance Auditing (** `run_performance_audit` **):** This is the \"Diagnostic Engine.\" It doesn't just display answers; it measures **LLM Speed** (tokens/sec), **Latency**, and **Context Precision**. It visualizes these metrics using Seaborn/Matplotlib to help users identify bottlenecks (e.g., is the delay in the Retriever or the LLM?).\n",

        "4. **Batch Processing Handler (** `process_pdf_handler` **):** Manages the \"Multi-File\" experience. It ensures that when a user drops 5 files into the UI, they are processed in parallel, categorized into \"Smart Filters,\" and mapped to the PDF viewer without losing track of which text belongs to which file."

        "3. **Tunneling:** By setting `share=True`, Gradio creates a secure public URL (e.g., `https://xyz123.gradio.live`). This allows you to test the mobile responsiveness of your platform or share the MVP with stakeholders without deploying to a cloud server.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Debugging:** `debug=True` is vital for the MVP stage. If the AI fails to process a specific PDF, the error logs will print directly in your notebook cell, allowing for immediate troubleshooting."
