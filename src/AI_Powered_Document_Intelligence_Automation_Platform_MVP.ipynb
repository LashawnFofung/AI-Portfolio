        "# **Final Project: 🤖 AI-Powered Document Intelligence Automation Platform MVP**\n",
        "\n",
        "Production-Grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Document Governance\n",
        "This platform is a high-performance solution for high-volume document environments (Legal, Finance, HR). Unlike generic RAG systems that suffer from **\"Context Contamination\"** (mixing unrelated data), this system uses **Intelligent Boundary Detection** and **Metadata-Rich Chunking** to isolate and retrieve precise document segments.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🛠️ MVP Objectives**\n",
        "- **Contextual Fidelity:** Eliminate hallucinations by segregating the vector space based on document classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Intelligent Automation:** Automatically split bulk PDFs (e.g., a 50-page file containing 5 different contracts) into distinct logical units.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hardware-Aware Versatility (Multi-Model Versatility):** Toggle between Gemini 2.0 (API), Mistral 7B, and Phi-2 (Local) with automated VRAM Deep Purges for stability on T4 GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Audit-Ready Compliance:** Every response is passed through a Quality Audit Gate before being displayed to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🏗️ Key Technical Architecture**\n",
        "The system follows a modular Six-Stage Execution Cycle:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Ingestion Layer:** Hybrid OCR (PyMuPDF + Tesseract) extracts text and images while preserving spatial metadata.\n",
        "2. **Intelligence Layer:** LLMs classify documents into a taxonomy (e.g., \"Invoice,\" \"Legal Agreement\") and detect page boundaries.\n",
        "3. **Storage Layer:** LlamaIndex + FAISS create Segregated Silos using metadata filters, preventing data leakage between files.\n",
        "4. **Orchestration Layer:** A Python-generator-based \"Thinking Loop\" manages asynchronous status updates and hardware state safety.\n",
        "5. **Audit Layer:** Automatic calculation of the **RAG Triad** (Faithfulness, Relevance, and Context Density).\n",
        "6. **Presentation Layer:** An **Obsidian-themed** Gradio UI with real-time PDF previewing and exportable audit reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **🌟 Core MVP Capabilities**\n",
        "- **Multi-Modal Routing:** Detects if a query is about \"Amounts\" vs. \"Legal Terms\" and targets the specific document silo automatically.\n",
        "- **VRAM Management:** A \"Safety Gate\" logic (`deep_purge_gpu`) ensures the system never crashes when switching between heavy local models and light API models.\n",
        "- **Performance Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of **Latency vs. Token Speed** and **Industry Ground Truth** benchmarks.\n",
        "- **Source Attribution:** Every AI response includes clickable citations (e.g., \"Source: Invoice (p. 4)\") to ensure human-in-the-loop verification.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "## **📖 How to Operate**\n",
        "- **Environment Setup:** Run Section 1 and 2 to install dependencies and configure your Gemini API Key in the Colab Secrets.\n",
        "- **Initialization:** Run the global configuration cells to load the BGE embedding model and initialize the default LLM.\n",
        "- **Select Engine:** Use the switch_llm function or the UI dropdown to select your preferred AI model (e.g., \"Gemini 2.0 Flash\").\n",
        "- **Upload & Process:** Upload your documents via the Gradio interface. The system will automatically classify and index them.\n",
        "- **Query & Audit:** Enter your business questions. Use the \"Audit Log\" tab to view performance metrics and download a professional PDF summary of the session.\n",
