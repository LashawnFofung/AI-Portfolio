# AI Product & Engineering Portfolio

### Bridging the gap between Technical Execution and Product Strategy

##

## 📖 About This Portfolio
Welcome to my digital workspace. This repository documents my journey in building Artificial Intelligence solutions. Unlike traditional engineering portfolios, this collection highlights a dual focus:

  - <b>AI Development:</b> Writing robust Python code, fine-tuning LLMs, and building RAG pipelines.

  - <b>Product Strategy:</b> Defining user needs, technical feasibility, and go-to-market logic for AI features.

##

## 🛠️ Tech & Tool Stack
  - <b>Core Development:</b>	Python,Colab, Git
  - <b>AI & ML:</b>	RAG, LlamaIndex, Gemini API, Hugging Face
  - <b>Product & Strategy:</b>	Jira, Figma, A/B Testing, Technical PRD Writing,
  - <b>Data Engineering:</b>	Pandas,PyMuPDF, Tesseract, EasyOCR, NumPy,

## 📂 Selected Projects

### 🚀 I. End-to-End AI Products (LLMs & GenAI)

<b>[AI-Powered Document Automation Platform:](https://github.com/LashawnFofung/AI-Powered-Document-Automation-Platform)</b>	
  - <b>The Product Problem:</b> Users spend too much time reading mortgage application documents.
  - <b>The "Tech" Solution:</b>
  	- Buiding a multi-stage pipeline using Python and OCR to digitize legacy mortgage blobs. Implemented Vector Search (RAG) to allow loan officers to 'chat' with loan applications and automated the extraction of key financial data into structured JSON for downstream underwriting systems. 	
  - <b>Stack:</b> Python, OCR, RAG, LLM,API
